# As Mushers Prepare for the Iditarod, Anomalies in Snow Depth and Sea Ice are a Growing Threat 
## By Kelly Kimball

With 1,000 miles of snow-covered land to travel across, international dog sled mushers of Alaska’s Iditarod are among the most competitive long-distance trail racers in the world. But in recent years, climate change has altered their game—and put themselves and their dogs at greater risk.
 
A recent [Arctic Report Card](https://arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2019) by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
 has found that the region is warming at a rate twice as fast as the global average, with the race’s starting line in [Anchorage charting at the second-highest winter temperatures in Alaska’s history](https://arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2019/ArtMID/7916/ArticleID/835/Surface-Air-Temperature). These findings demonstrate a paradigm shift in the area’s sensitive environmental conditions, where snow is melting earlier or barely accumulating to its normal depths, and [age-old landscapes built on permafrost](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/weather/2019/12/17/as-alaska-permafrost-melts-roads-sink-bridges-tilt-and-greenhouse-gases-escape/) are becoming upended, leaving behind devastated infrastructure and rock-hard ice that leads to race injuries, melting ice bridges, and [race cancellations](https://www.adn.com/sports/2019/12/14/organizers-call-off-knik-200-because-of-poor-trail-copper-basin-300-still-on-as-planned-but-could-use-cold-weather/) of a sport closely tied to the state’s history and cultural heritage.
 
But two data points that are at the top of every musher's mind, come March, are the dwindling snow depth in Alaska’s interior, and dwindling sea ice off Alaska’s coast that would normally protect the land from climate extremes.
“A dog’s ideal running temperature is probably zero to 20 below. It really gets to be dangerous to run dogs above fifteen or twenty degrees,” says Dr. Ken Tape, who is an assistant professor at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. “You really have to be careful about working them to their maximum potential.”
Having lived in Alaska since 1982, Tape has seen firsthand how incredible Alaska’s weather anomalies can get, and how such affects touch down on everyday life in unavoidable ways.
