# As Mushers Prepare for the Iditarod, Anomalies in Snow Depth and Sea Ice are a Growing Threat 
## By Kelly Kimball

With 1,000 miles of snow-covered land to travel across, international dog sled mushers of Alaska’s Iditarod are among the most competitive long-distance trail racers in the world. But in recent years, climate change has altered their game—and put themselves and their dogs at greater risk.
 
A recent [Arctic Report Card](https://arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2019) by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has found that the region is warming at a rate twice as fast as the global average, with the race’s starting line in [Anchorage charting at the second-highest winter temperatures in Alaska’s history](https://arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2019/ArtMID/7916/ArticleID/835/Surface-Air-Temperature). These findings demonstrate a paradigm shift in the area’s sensitive environmental conditions, where snow is melting earlier or barely accumulating to its normal depths, and [age-old landscapes built on permafrost](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/weather/2019/12/17/as-alaska-permafrost-melts-roads-sink-bridges-tilt-and-greenhouse-gases-escape/) are becoming upended, leaving behind devastated infrastructure and rock-hard ice that leads to race injuries, melting ice bridges, and [race cancellations](https://www.adn.com/sports/2019/12/14/organizers-call-off-knik-200-because-of-poor-trail-copper-basin-300-still-on-as-planned-but-could-use-cold-weather/) of a sport closely tied to the state’s history and cultural heritage.
 
But two data points that are at the top musher's minds, come March, are the dwindling snow depths in Alaska’s interior, and dwindling sea ice off Alaska’s coast that would normally protect the land from climate extremes.

“A dog’s ideal running temperature is probably zero to 20 below. It really gets to be dangerous to run dogs above fifteen or twenty degrees,” says Dr. Ken Tape, who is an assistant professor at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. “You really have to be careful about working them to their maximum potential.”

Having lived in Alaska since 1982, Tape has seen firsthand how incredible Alaska’s weather anomalies can get, and how they touch down on everyday life in unavoidable ways. Based on his ecological research, parts of southwest Alaska and western Alaska—regions through which the Iditarod passes—are experiencing some of the most rapid changes in temperature. Last year’s numbers from NASA chart snow depth as shallow as 16.6 micrometers and only as deep as 89.3 micrometers (which is less than a third of an inch).

“There's been growth in dry land racing, which is racing on wheels. A lot of times those dogs may not pull sleds at all,” said musher and adventurer Blair Braverman, who competed in the Iditarod last year.

Recent findings from NASA have shown that these snow depths have begun to narrow in range over time. Snow depth is a crucial measurement for mushers to consider, and it's an important figure to help describe Alaska's ecological balance.  
According to Dr. Brian Brettschneiderman, an assistant professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, a reduction in the forest snow cover is devastating as the yellow cedar tree population, which is a tree species with shallow roots that depends on heavy snow cover for protection.

“If you don’t have the snow on the ground, and you have a cold outbreak, the frost line goes down and kills the roots and the yellow feeder,” Brettscheiderman explains.

“If you've ever seen, totem poles, they are from yellow cedar. It's extremely culturally important. And those trees have been devastated by warming temperatures with the reduction of snowpack in southeast Alaska.”

Although winter in Alaska this year has experienced a more traditional winter than it has in the last 6 years—with temperatures consistently below 40 degrees Fahrenheit coupled with hearty snowfall—the current season joins its predecessors with a fair share of weather anomalies. 
 
The Iditarod’s Anchorage-to-Nome route will take roughly 54 Iditarod competitors through three distinct climate zones—from the Alaskan coastline that catapults mushers across arctic sea ice, to a mountainous and windy interior, to barren plains usually steeped in several feet of snow. Each of these three regions are experiencing shifts which make for an immense undertaking for race administrators to monitor.

“It is a one-thousand-mile trail. That is a huge undertaking to put in a trail of that length and have it be all decent quality,” explains Tape. “A lot of this environment is warm enough that they're getting these melt events, [which] create ice. And so, harder trails tend to be hard on dogs.”

For University of Alaska Fairbanks professorial emeritus Dr. Carl Benson, categorically higher temperatures are not only influencing snow depth, it’s also affecting sea ice, which in turn affects Alaska’s interior. 
 
“[Higher temperatures’ have changed Alaska’s coast from a continental climate with the sea ice extending the continent to very much a maritime climate,” said Benson.

Veteran musher and writer Dee Dee Jonrowe notes that less sea ice has given Alaska much more storm and snowfall along the Bering Sea coast, which is a section of the race that is among the most dependant of lower temperatures and sea ice quantity. Without it, racers could be left stranded, which is precisely what happened to Jonrowe during an Iditarod in the early 2000s.
 
Sea ice protects Alaska's interior from more weather anomalies. The less sea ice, the more volatile the weather is from day to day. Compounding this issue is the fact that the Iditarod [will now punctuate a new international circuit of races with Norway and Russia for the first time in its 47 year history](https://www.adn.com/iditarod-2019/2019/10/23/iditarod-joins-new-international-race-circuit-in-an-effort-to-increase-exposure-showcase-dog-care/). 
 
“[Alaska doesn’t] have these real strong minimum [temperatures] they used to,” said Benson. “Water has the highest latent heat of any substance that we deal with, which absorbs four times more radiant energy than an ice surface.”
 
This means that Alaska’s lands in now spending more time absorbing heat form the sun during limited cloud cover than it is retracting the heat. 
 
For a sport that is inextricably linked to the elements in order to remain relevant to the Arctic Circle, mushers point to the relationship between musher and animal as the heart of the sport.
 
“It's addicting,” says Blair Bravernman.

“Once you get on a dog sled … it's the most pleasurable thing a person can do. … It's really sort of transcendent and getting to experience that with them.”

For many competing mushers caught in the tumult of a rapidly-changing climate, the Iditarod is more than a yearly snow race to show off canine brawn. Rather, it’s an international test of agility and one of Alaska’s many prides—a sport with heart and indigenous roots; a horizontal Everest at the top of the world.

“I am living, the history of our state,” Dee Dee Jonrowe says. “You're utilizing your own skill, your own ability to read dogs, to read the weather, to listen to the stories of the elders.”
