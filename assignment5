# Assignment 5
 
### By Kelly Kimball
 
With 1,000 miles of wild snow-covered land to travel across, international dog sled competitors of Alaska’s Iditarod are among the premier long-distance racers in the world. But climate change has altered their game—and put themselves and their dogs at greater risk.
 
A recent climate report has calculated that Alaska is warming at a rate [twice as fast as the global average] (https://www.arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2019/ArtMID/7916/ArticleID/844/Permafrost-and-the-Global-Carbon-Cycle), with the race’s starting line in [Anchorage charting at the second-highest winter temperatures in Alaska’s history] (https://arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2019/ArtMID/7916/ArticleID/835/Surface-Air-Temperature). Snow is melting or barely accumulating, and age-old landscapes built on permafrost are being upended, leaving behind a kind of rock-hard ice that leads to animal injuries and race cancellations. 
 
Compounding this issue is the fact that the Iditarod has joined an international circuit of races with Norway and Russia for the first time in its 47 year history. The stakes could not be higher for a sport that is inextricably linked to the elements in order to remain relevant and viable to the Arctic Circle.
 
Above all, the Iditarod is more than a yearly snow race to show off canine brawn. It’s the ultimate international test of agility and one of Alaska’s many prides—a sport with heart and indigenous roots; a horizontal Everest at the top of the world.
 
I’d like to capture the unique tension that Iditarod loyalists are in by producing a photo essay that shadows competitors, scientists and veterinarians close to the issue.
