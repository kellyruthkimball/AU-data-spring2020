# Assignment 2: My Own Data Set
### I’m curious about how much church trials cost within the United Methodist Church. This data could turn into a story because, as the UMC denomination enacts a bill that bans LGBT clergy and same-sex marriage, it puts Bishops—the most powerful leaders in the denomination—in a bind that forces them to call existing LGBT folks, both clergy and laymen within the church, into the public eye and into an unruly theological justice system that has the potential to eek funds from humanitarian missions, which are core to the denomination’s Christian values. 
## Here is what I want to know about this data point:
What line items are involved with church trials? (ex: Hotels for jury and judge, electricity, appeals system, the cost for a replacement clergymembers to take the place of the clergyperson on trial, and miscellaneous)
What are the factors that make this data point exist? A report from a United Methodist Church news service states that “Associates in Advocacy (AIA), recently were cited by United Methodist Insight as saying that a church trial costs $100,000 or more,” while appeals cost as much as $60,000. See the source [here.](https://um-insight.net/in-the-church/the-costs-of-church-trials/)
Where do apportionate funds come from, and will they be under threat if there is an onslaught of new trials across the denomination? See [here.](https://www.gcfa.org/services/financial-services/general-church-budget/umc-budget-apportioned-funds/)
## How I will go about finding this data:
I spoke with Anne Brown, who is a lawyer, Methodist and active member of DC’s Foundry United Methodist Church which is leading the charge locally to seceed from the global denomination because of its bigoted new law. With her knowledge and asking about the line items from a trial in 2014 in Pennsylvania as well as a trial in the early 2000s in northern Virginia, I will have enough to discern a set of data points.
Documentation of clergy salaries and trial costs from other types of defrocking incidents historically experienced within the UMC. 
Data on the UMC budget, especially the proportion of “Apportion Funds,” and where it comes from.
