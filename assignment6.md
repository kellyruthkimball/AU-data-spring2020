## Steps to Clean Data: 
1. Received data from the DC Metropolitan Policy Department for all crimes over the last 4 years near 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW within 2000 feet.
2. Made a pivot table that tallied up the total number of violent crimes by year and propert crimes by year.
3. Noticed an increase in violent crime incidents in the years 2016 to 2020 and decided to make a new chart that shows the same data but from the years 2012 to 2020. (I would have done further back if they DC PD website allowed me to!)
4. Created a new pivot table across 8 years using the same parameters and noticed that there has indeed been a slight increase in violent crime within 2000 feel of the White House. 


## Headline: Violent Crime has steadily increased near the White House

During the final leg of then-President Barack Obama's presidency, violent crime near the White House averaged at 24 incidents per year. But in these last four years, violent crime in the area has jumped to 30 incidents per year on average. What consistutes this change, and is DC Mayor Muriel Bowser's [crime prevention initiative](https://dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-launches-2019-fall-crime-prevention-initiative) working applicably? . For this story, I'll pull from DC PD crime data for violent crimes committed over the last 8 years within 2000 fee of the White House, and compare it to the fluctuations in crime over that same period of time within other neighborhoods that Mayor Bowser's intiative is focusing on. Namely, I will hone in on violent crime fluctuations in the U Street corridor, Southwest, and Shaw regions, and compare to the area around the White House.
