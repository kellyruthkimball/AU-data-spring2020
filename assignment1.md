# Two Data Journalism Story Ideas
 
### By Kelly Kimball | Jan. 18, 2020
 
##Idea #1: A story about decisionmaking influence within the United Methodist Church.
 
In February of last year, the global United Methodist Church passed a sweeping law that banned same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy from its denomination. This law was officially enacted in January of this year, and with it, a call among UMC leaders to separate from the denomination and its practices that secessionists deemed exclusionary. I'd like to do a data study that visualizes the scope of political influence or electoral power that each region of the UMC has that would allow this kind of law to be enacted. Alternatively, I am interested in doing a data story on the cost of church trials, and its potential to leech money from the UMC's other humanitarian projects, foundations, clinics, and charities—which is a part of their budget called the “apportionate fund” system.
 
###Sample Story: Slate did a map and chart that ranked the electoral power of each state based on population. It’s a very helpful and thorough take on how unbalanced an electoral system could be, and which regions unexpectedly have influence over political decision-making.
 
[here](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/map_of_the_week/2012/11/presidential_election_a_map_showing_the_vote_power_of_all_50_states.html)
 
##Execution = 5 
It was a map that ranked and color-coded the electoral power of each state (including Washington, D.C.) based on population size. In a way, it did say so in the headline, which read, “How powerful is your vote? When it comes to voting, not all states are created equal.” 
I will give the infographic a grade of 5 for its ease in navigating the information. I believe it was the most efficient way to navigate and present data. An even better way to do it is to make it a google map so that the colors and presentation are a little bit more visually appealing. Another idea to add more nuance to this chart is to compare individual voting power compared to other states. For example, if I moved to Wyoming, I would have the voting power of how many people in California?  
I will give the accuracy of the data a 4, because they included Washington, D.C., which has no voting power but was ranked 3rd most powerful electoral influence on the map. They should have made it clear in the infographic that D.C.’s data is hypothetical. They showed clearly that this is a chart based off of 2010 Census data. To add more nuance to this data, I would look into National Voter Registration Act data to see how many people actually registered to vote, plus their political leanings. I would also look into the Pew Voting Frequency Survey, too, for the same reason.

##Accuracy = 5
I believe the map is perfectly accurate.This link [here] (https://www.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-data-map.html) is an interactive map of the last decade of apportionments in the US. An even more accurate map would be one that looks at population shifts over time, and how they may have affected a state’s electoral power. They clearly provide a source, which is the 2010 census redistricting data. They do not explain that Washington, D.C. has no voting power, which I thought was a disappointing oversight.

##Quality = 3
The colors and design are a bit basic, but they still get the job done. An upside to this is that the design was simple, minimalist and to the point. The graphic did accomplish its task, no more and no less. More nuance would have been appreciated, but its simplicity is also its power.
Objective Grade: 3. The color and design does not match well with Slates branding. It did not look like it belonged with the rest of the website and piece. The map is teal, beige and white, while Slate’s branding is purple and black. Even then, Slate’s branding overall has changed a lot over the years. However, despite the off-brand color scheme, the way that the shades and colors help a reader understand the information is excellent: it draws your eye to the right deductions.

##Creativity = 3
The piece was more utilitarian than creative. The used lighter and darker shades of color to emphasize information. It left frills out.

##Idea #2: A story about climate change in the Arctic Circle and its affect on the health and safety of sled dogs competing in the Iditarod, and/or a story about the ups and downs of funding for the Iditarod, given that 2020 is the first year it its history that it will be joining a larger international circuit of similar races in Russia and Norway.
With over 1,000 miles of open, snow-covered land to travel across, international competitors of the Iditarod are considered to be the premier long-distance racers in the world. But climate change has altered the game for not only the competitors, but the 8 to 11 sled dogs they depend on. I’d like to do a story on the number of veteran versus rookie competitors, and the potential for a loss of interest or a deeper issue with race entrance that may be revealed from such data. Alternatively, I’d like to do a story on carbon emissions in the arctic and how it recently changed from a carbon sink to a carbon emitter due to the rapid melting of permafrost.
 
###Sample Story: The Visual Capitalist did a map on the anatomy of land use in the United States. [Here.] (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/america-land-use/)
Clarity and accuracy = 5
It was a dot map that visually captured how much land is used in certain ways across the united states. It was both in the headline and represented visually. This was indeed the most efficient way to navigate this kind of information, and the data seemed trustworthy and accurate. I give its accuracy a grade of 5 as well. I would recommend that the reporter verify these numbers using USDA data [here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2017/december/a-primer-on-land-use-in-the-united-states/)

##Quality = 5
This graphic accomplishes every task of presenting, comparing, organizing and correlating. They did well in showing how much land these dots of information would take up with they were condensed and organized across the country geographically. And, in the article itself, it broke down the data points into further detailed graphics. It was a well-done article and set of data reporting! 

##Type and Color = 5
The type and color went beautifully with the publication brand colors and overall mood. Everything looked like it belonged together, leading the eye to the most important bits of information. The colors were complementary to each other and even matched how the colored hyperlinks and text color in the piece. Very well done! 

##Creativity = 5
The map switched between showing where the type of land use was physically located on the map, and then condensed it to show what it would all look like it these categories were all together. It was a creative way for a reader to quickly visualize and understand how each data point if realistically distributed across the US.
