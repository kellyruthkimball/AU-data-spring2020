# Two Data Journalism Story Ideas

### By Kelly Kimball | Jan. 18, 2020

##Idea #1: A story about politics, influence and cost of anti-LGBT trials within the United Methodist Church.

In February of last year, the global United Methodist Church passed a sweeping law that banned same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy from its 
denomination. This law was officially enacted in January of this year, and with it, a call among UMC leaders to separate from the denomination and practices that secessionists deemed exclusionary. I'd like to do a data study that visualizes the scope of political influence or electoral power that each region of the UMC has that would allow this kind of law to be enacted. Alternatively, I am interested in doing a data story on the cost of church trials, and its potential to leech money from the UMC's other humanitarian projects, foundations, clinics, and charities—which is a part of their budget called the apportionate fund system.

###Sample Story: Slate did a map and chart that ranked the electoral power of each state based on population. It’s a very helpful and thorough take on how unbalanced an electoral system could be, and which regions unexpecetedly have influence over political decision-making.

##Idea #2: A story about climate change in the Arctic Circle and its affect on the health a safety of sled dogs competing in the Iditarod; OR, a story about the ups and downs of funding for the Iditarod, given that 2020 is the first year it its history that it will be joining a larger international circuit of similar races in Russia and Norway.

With over 1,000 miles of open, snow-covered land to travel across, international competitors of the Iditarod are considered to be the premier long-distance racers in the world. But climate change has altered the game for not only the competitors, but the 8 to 11 sled dogs they depend on. I’d like to do a story on the number of veteran versus rookie competitors, and the potential for a loss of interest or a deeper issue with race entrance that may be revealed from such data. Alternatively, I’d like to do a story on carbon emissions in the arctic and how it recently changed from a carbon sink to a carbon emitter due to the rapid melting of permafrost.

###Sample Story: ESPN did a thorough longform story on the dangers and risks the await Iditarod competitors, complete with maps, images and illustrations.
