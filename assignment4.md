# Assignment 4: Political Leanings at the New York Times—then and now

## By Kelly Kimball

I found that 100% of employees of the New York Times Company that have records of contributions on FEC from 2019 to 2020 made contributions to Democratic candidates or entities that supported democratic platforms between 2019 to 2020. And the only presidential candidates that were earmarked for donations were for Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. This could pose as an issue for readers who seek to read high-quality content from a diverse news-making entity that reports intimately across the country and world.
 
To follow up on this story, I would compare these contributions to those that were made from 2007 to 2008 (during then-Sen. Barack Obama’s presidential race) and again from 1999 to 2000 (during then-Texas Governor George W. Bush’s presidential race). I will then speak with politically active NYT employees, [experts from Neiman labs](https://www.pewresearch.org/staff/elizabeth-grieco/) who focus on media transparency, [Farai Chideya of Neiman Labs](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/02/newsroom-employees-are-less-diverse-than-u-s-workers-overall/) who reported on racial and ethnic diversity in political reporting, as well as Pew Research expert Elizabeth who specializes in newsroom diversity, especially as it related to newsroom efficacy in the “Trump era.”  

In order to find my story, I did the following:
Searched the FEC website for donations in the 2019-2020 election cycle from employees of "New York Times,” “New York Times Company,” “NYT,” and “NYTC” and verified that their occupation was a position that intuitively correlated to a New York Times company position.
 
Exported a CSV file of the results & copy-pasted into a Google Sheet
Repeated the previous step for the years 2007-2008 and 1999-2000
For all three CSVs, I:
Analyzed where contributions were made to by searching under the column “committee_name.”
Did light data “cleaning” by manually deleting rows that had employers labeled anything other than the New York Times

## Nut graf: Of the 566 employees of the New York Times with recorded campaign contributions, 100% donated to campaigns or organizations affiliated with the Democtatic party. For a newspaper that reports intimately across the country and world, is this okay?
