# Assignment 3: Cleaning a Data Set, Methodology
### By Kelly Kimball
1. The original file separated the data into U.S.-based jurisdictions and non-U.S. jurisdictions. I condensed the file from two sets of data into one set of data by deleting excess rows. 
2. Next, I took away commas from the numbers using the Find+Replace capabilities.
3. I then took away any spaces between numbered values. For example, a value that was "98 999," I changed to "98999" using the Find+Replace capability. 
4. As a result of the commas and spaces, some numbere values were left-justified. I cleaned this up by right-justifying all numbered values. 
5. Using Sublime, I got rid of all leading zeros.
